                        connecting aws in commends first --
C:\Users\akash>cd Documents\awscredentials

then check .pem file present or not---
C:\Users\akash>Documents\awscredentials>expensekey.pem

then connect with aws ssh ---
ssh -i "expensekey.pem" ec2-user@ec2-3-110-123-199.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com

                        Then installing nodejs in linux-------
        First search on google yum install npm. And you will get a stack Overflow website for details.                 
After connecting with aws you will get "[ec2-user@ip-172-31-42-46 ~]$"
run it as "sudo su" -- you will become a super user.
  [ec2-user@ip-172-31-42-46 ~]$ sudo su

To get out from a super user press ctrl+d.

you will be a root user and lyou will get  "[root@ip-172-31-42-46 ec2-user]#"
 
here run   "curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -"
[root@ip-172-31-42-46 ec2-user]# curl --silent --location https://rpm.nodesource.com/setup_20.x | bash -

then it will say "Repository is configured and updated. Run 'dnf install nodejs -y' to complete the installation." 
 here you will run "sudo yum install -y nodejs"
[root@ip-172-31-42-46 ec2-user]# sudo yum install -y nodejs


                        Then installing git in linux-----
git email -- "babaidutta222001@gmail.com"
git password -- "Ashok dutta1"

After installing nodejs you have to install git
To install git you only run "sudo yum install git -y"
To check git version you can run "git -v"

Git personal access token -- "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"
To login in github use this access token in commend prompt.
it Won't be visible when you paste in commend prompt for security reason. So just paste and enter.

After login you have to enter "git clone 'enter https url' "
Example: git clone  https://github.com/MAFIYADSR/Lets-get-started-with-typescript.git

After going to Repository you can just enter "ls" . It will show file name which is inside this.
Example: [ec2-user@ip-172-31-42-46 ~]$ ls
ans -- 22-Deploying-to-AWS-with-CICD-pipelines

If you enter pwd it will show ec2 home.
"[ec2-user@ip-172-31-42-46 ~]$ pwd
/home/ec2-user"

To go inside the you have to enter "cd Repository name"
Example : "[ec2-user@ip-172-31-42-46 ~]$ cd 22-Deploying-to-AWS-with-CICD-pipelines"
It will show all the files inside this Repository. 

If you wants to add new folder in git repository you have to run "mkdir 'filename'"
Example: "[root@ip-172-31-42-46 22-Deploying-to-AWS-with-CICD-pipelines]# mkdir newwork"
It will create a new folder name "newwork" in repository.

If you want to delete something you have to run "rm -rf 'file name'"
Example: "[root@ip-172-31-42-46 22-Deploying-to-AWS-with-CICD-pipelines]# rm -rf newwork"
It will remove  "newwork" folder from repository.

IF you are wants to go inside a git repository just type "cd  'repositry name' "
Example: cd Deploying-to-AWS-with-CICD-pipelines

IF you are inside a git repository and you want to back to root user just type "cd ../"
Example: [root@ip-172-31-42-46 Deploying-to-AWS-with-CICD-pipelines]# cd ../

IF you are inside git repository and you want to see hidden/private files like .gitignore etc just type "ls -la"
Example: [root@ip-172-31-42-46 Deploying-to-AWS-with-CICD-pipelines]# ls -la

If you want to edit .env file so just enter "vi .env"
If not works then check you have many branches. To check branches enter "git branch -a"
Then choose original branch and go to that branch by entering "git checkout 'branchname' "
  Then enter "vi .env" to edit.
  When you want to edit in vi just press "i"
  When you want to save and exit in vi just press "Escap(Esc) colan(:)  wq"
  When you want  exit without saving in vi just press "Escap(Esc) colan(:)  q"


                Connect to mysql----

First create rds data base
My Database username = akashdutta
password = ashokdutta
Endpoint = database-1.c1g4oqcqg9xw.ap-south-1.rds.amazonaws.com
Ec2 security group = sg-0bd2aba9d3dd6dc54

        Nodemon problem--------->

    If "sudo npm i" is not work you can do this forcefully using this commmand.
    "sudo npm install --unsafe-pern=true --allow-root"

If you run nodemon in other editor you can't run in same port in commmand promt.
it will show something like this --
"Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3000"

To kill this i have to run "lsof -i :3000" 
then check PID number.
then run "kill 'PID number'"
like this "[root@ip-172-31-11-228 Deploying-to-AWS-with-CICD-pipelines]# kill 29901"

Don't use ndoemon. Insted of nodemon use pm2.
use "npm i -g pm2 to install".
Use "pm2 start app.js".
Use "pm2 status" to see server running or not.
use "pm2 stop all" to stop pm2.
use pm2 logs to see logs 


          Installing jenkins-----------
If you are running code as a super user first get out from a super user using ctrl+d.
Then add the jenkins repo using the following commmand.
"sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo \
    https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.repo"

Then import a key file from the jenkins-cl to enable installation from the package
"sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat/jenkins.io-2023.key"
Then run "sudo yum upgrade" to upgarde.
then install java
"sudo dnf install java-11-amazon-corretto -y"
then install jenkins
"sudo dnf install jenkins"
then enable jenkins
"sudo systemctl enable jenkins"
then start jenkins
"sudo systemctl start jenkins"
then check status jenkins. It will show running
"sudo systemctl status jenkins"

To configure jenkins in website.
You have to rn it 8080 port.
"localhost:8080"
Here localhost is your open address in aws ec2.

There copy "/var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword"
and paste it in commmand promt as super user using vi.
Example"sudo vi /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword"
You will gate password .
here password is "bc0345d5a1e747399a86d1535699f0ca"
to get out from password pannel press :qa+Enter

Then put the password in jenkins page.
Then customise jenkins page will open.
Go with "Install suggested plugins".

Then create user in jenkins.
username- akashdutta
password- ashokdutta1
fullname- Akash dutta
email- babaidutta222001@gmail.com
jenkins url- http://localhost:8080/

Then enter getting started.
From dashbord click on manage jenkins-> credentials-> system-> Global credentials (unrestricted)
-> Add credentials
In username section enter git email.
In password section enter git password.
in description section enter git credentials.
Else leave as defult.

Now go to dashbord-> New Item->Enter name(Her i give expensetracker)
->Freestyle Project-> Ok
Then next page will open. There in source code management select git
Then select git repository url.
Then select credential you made recently.
then in advance section select brach name. (Here my brach is master)
Save it. And build now.
If done then go to build history and click on date. Then console output and check its done or not.
If done from Building in workspace line copy the url and paste it in commmand as ec2 user using cd.
Example: "cd /var/lib/jenkins/workspace"
Then enter ls and it will show expensetracker file.
Then change the directory in expensetracker using cd .
Example: "cd expensetracker"
Then do ls to see files. and do ls -la to see hidden files also

jenkins Building in workspace /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/expensetracker"
run it using cd.( change directory)
